## Overview
Water quality is a critical factor for public health and the environment. This project utilizes supervised machine learning models to analyze water quality parameters and predict quality levels. The primary objective is to create an efficient model that can identify potential issues in water quality based on given input features.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes features such as pH, turbidity, hardness, conductivity, and other key parameters. The target variable represents the water quality classification (e.g., safe, unsafe, or levels of contamination).  
- **Source:** [Add dataset source or provide details if it's custom].

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Addressed missing values and normalized data using `StandardScaler`.
   - Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
   - Identified and treated outliers using box plot inspection.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Selected the most relevant features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained multiple machine learning models including SVM, CatBoost, and LightGBM.
   - Optimized hyperparameters using grid search.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Models Used
